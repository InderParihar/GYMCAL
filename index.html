            <p>The scientific term for body fat is "adipose tissue." 
                Adipose tissue serves a number of important functions.
                 Its primary purpose is to store lipids from which the
                  body creates energy. In addition, it secretes a number
                   of important hormones, and provides the body with some
                    cushioning as well as insulation.</p>

            <a href="ffmical.html"><h2>FFMI Calculator</h2></a>
            <p>FFMI is conceptually similar to Body Mass Index (BMI). But
                 instead of measuring body mass in relation to height, it
                  measures the amount of muscles (fat-free mass) relative
                   to a person's height. This indicator accounts for the
                    amount of total lean muscle mass in the body. Research
                     also suggests it can predict how much muscle your body
                      can potentially gain.</p>

            <p>
                Many people seek to lose weight, and often the easiest way
                 to do this is to consume fewer calories each day. But how
                  many calories does the body actually need in order to be
                   healthy? This largely depends on the amount of physical
                    activity a person performs each day, and regardless of
                     this, is different for all people â€“ there are many
                      different factors involved, not all of which are 
                      well-understood or known.

            <p>
                Repetition maximum is often expressed as 1RM or one-repetition maximum.
                 This indicates the heaviest weight you can lift with maximum effort in
                  a single repetition. A 1RM is your personal weightlifting record for
                   a squat, deadlift, or any other weightlifting exercise.
